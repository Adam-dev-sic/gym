    name: "Barbell Bench Press",
    description: "The Barbell Bench Press is a foundational compound exercise that primarily targets the pectoralis major muscles of the chest, while also engaging the anterior deltoids and triceps brachii. Performed lying on a flat bench, the movement involves lowering a barbell to the chest and pressing it upward until the arms are fully extended. This exercise is a staple in strength training and bodybuilding routines, renowned for its effectiveness in building upper body strength, muscle mass, and power. Proper form is crucial to maximize muscle activation and minimize the risk of shoulder or elbow injuries. Variations in grip width and bench angle can further emphasize different regions of the chest and supporting muscles.",
